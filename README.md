This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
This is essentially a clone of wayback machine cron tasking a worker process to interact with a node server to scrape and save data to a temp cache for viewing. 

1. git clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. navigate to localhost:8080
